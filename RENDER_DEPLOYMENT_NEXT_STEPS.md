# Render Deployment Next Steps - Oregon Region Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ Code changes complete - Ready for Render deployment
**Commit**: 70669c9 (render.yaml region alignment to Oregon)

---

## Summary of Changes

All services in render.yaml have been aligned to **Oregon region**:

```yaml
✅ Web Service (gemini-chat-app): region: oregon
✅ PostgreSQL (gemini-chat-db): region: oregon
✅ Worker Service (gemini-chat-worker): region: oregon
✅ Redis (gemini-chat-redis): region: oregon
```

**Why Oregon?** Your original project configuration was Oregon. This alignment enables:
- Same-region deployment = internal network communication
- Proper DNS resolution between services (fromService works correctly)
- Redis connection via fromService environment variable expansion

---

## Root Cause of Previous Redis Failures

**Cross-region problem (RESOLVED)**:
- ❌ OLD: Worker (Singapore) + Redis (Oregon) = different regions = external network = DNS failures
- ✅ NEW: All services in Oregon = same region = internal network = DNS works

---

## Required Manual Actions on Render Dashboard

Since you've already deleted both Worker and Redis services, follow these steps to create them in Oregon:

### Step 1: Create Redis Service in Oregon

1. Go to **Render Dashboard** (https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **New +** → **Blueprint**
3. Select your GitHub repository: `TakahiroNohara/gemini-chat-app-final`
4. Branch: `main`
5. Click **Deploy**

**Render will automatically:**
- Read render.yaml (now with all services set to oregon)
- Create Redis in Oregon region
- Create Worker in Oregon region
- Configure fromService environment variables correctly

### Step 2: Verify Services Deployed Successfully

After Blueprint deployment completes:

```
✅ Check Render Dashboard Services:
   - gemini-chat-app (Web) - oregon region
   - gemini-chat-worker (Worker) - oregon region
   - gemini-chat-db (PostgreSQL) - oregon region
   - gemini-chat-redis (Redis) - oregon region
```

### Step 3: Manual Deploy Each Service

1. **Web Service (gemini-chat-app)**
   - Click service
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Wait for logs to show success
   - No errors expected

2. **Worker Service (gemini-chat-worker)**
   - Click service
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - **Critical verification in logs**:
     ```
     ✅ Redis connection established (attempt N/5)
     Starting RQ worker on queue 'default'...
     ```
   - If these messages appear: SUCCESS ✅
   - If error messages appear: check Redis connection (see troubleshooting)

---

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Web Service Logs
```
No Redis errors expected
- Flask app starts normally
- Gunicorn accepts connections on port 8080
```

### Worker Service Logs
```
Connecting to Redis: redis://[internal-url]...
✅ Redis connection established (attempt 1/5)
Starting RQ worker on queue 'default'...
Worker listening on queue 'default'...
```

**This is the success state.** If you see these messages, the region alignment has resolved the issue.

---

## If fromService Still Fails (Unlikely but Possible)

If Worker logs show Redis connection error despite region alignment:

**Fallback Option**: Manual REDIS_URL Configuration

1. Go to **gemini-chat-worker** service → **Environment** tab
2. Look for `REDIS_URL` (should be auto-generated from fromService)
3. If missing or invalid:
   - Go to **gemini-chat-redis** service → **Info** tab
   - Copy the **Internal Database URL** (format: `redis://...`)
   - Paste into Worker's `REDIS_URL` environment variable
   - Click "Save"
   - Manual Deploy Worker again

**Reference**: See REDIS_RECREATION_GUIDE.md (Section: "Scenario B: fromService fails") for detailed steps.

---

## Code Changes Completed

The following improvements were already implemented (you can reference in git log):

1. **build.sh** - Temporary SECRET_KEY and dummy DATABASE_URL for Worker build phase
2. **run_worker.py** - Enhanced error handling with URL validation and exponential backoff retry
3. **render.yaml** - All regions set to oregon, fromService configured for Redis

No further code changes needed before deployment.

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Worker Service Health**
   ```
   ✅ Logs show: "✅ Redis connection established"
   ✅ Deep Research jobs are processing
   ✅ No Redis connection errors
   ```

2. **Deep Research Functionality**
   - Create a new conversation
   - Send a search-heavy query (e.g., "天気予報" / "news")
   - Verify Deep Research job is created and processed
   - Check that results are returned correctly

3. **No Error Patterns**
   - No repeated connection failures
   - No DNS resolution errors
   - No timeout errors

---

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

If deployment to Oregon region causes unexpected issues:

1. **Check render.yaml** - All services must be in oregon (they are ✅)
2. **Check service region** - Verify in Render dashboard all services show "Oregon"
3. **Re-deploy using Blueprint** - Render creates services fresh with correct config
4. **Contact Render Support** - If issue persists, file a ticket with details

---

## Summary

**Code Status**: ✅ READY
**Next Action**: Deploy via Render Dashboard (Blueprint or Manual Deploy)
**Expected Outcome**: Worker service connects to Redis via fromService
**Success Indicator**: Logs show `✅ Redis connection established`

Your configuration is now production-ready. The region alignment should resolve all previous Redis connection issues.

**Questions or Issues?** Check the logs in Render Dashboard. The error messages in run_worker.py:125-127 will guide you on next steps if something unexpected occurs.
